A very verbose guide to some very basic shell commands like cd and ls. Actually only cd and ls for now.

Whats next?
Since its October I'm going to start work on implementing curses into the project. I want to make a nicer output than the confusing mess I have now.

Quick how to once the app is running:\n
The cd command accepts: cd, cd .., and cd /any/valid/path2directory\n
The ls command is just ls\n
To stop running type stop
